        "Eg:\n",
        "Imagine you're trying to decide which restaurant to visit based on the recommendations of your friends. KNN is like asking your nearest neighbors (friends) which\n",
        " restaurants they like the most.\n",
        "The restaurant that most of your nearest neighbors recommend is likely the one you'll choose to visit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question: What is the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm used for?\n",
        "Answer: The K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.\n",
        "In classification, it predicts the class of a data point based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question: How does the KNN algorithm work?\n",
        "Answer: To make a prediction for a new data point, the KNN algorithm identifies the k nearest neighbors to\n",
        "that point based on a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance). It then assigns the majority class among those neighbors\n",
        " as the predicted class for the new data point.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question: What is the importance of choosing the value of k in KNN?\n",
        "Answer: The choice of k affects the performance and behavior of the KNN algorithm. Smaller values of k lead to more flexible models\n",
        " that are sensitive to noise, while larger values of k lead to smoother decision boundaries but may overlook local patterns in the data.\n",
        "  The optimal value of k is often determined through experimentation and cross-validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question: How do you handle categorical variables in the KNN algorithm?\n",
        "Answer: Categorical variables need to be converted into numerical format before applying the KNN algorithm.\n",
        "This can be done through techniques like one-hot encoding, where each category is represented as a binary feature,\n",
        "or label encoding, where each category is assigned a unique numerical value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the KNN algorithm?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages: KNN is simple to understand and implement, does not require training time,\n",
        "and can be effective for non-linear classification tasks.\n",
        "Disadvantages: It can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets, as it requires calculating\n",
        " distances between all data points. It is also sensitive to the choice of distance metric and the value of k.\n",
        "Question: How do you evaluate the performance of a KNN classifier?\n",
        "Answer: The performance of a KNN classifier can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall,\n",
        "F1-score, and ROC-AUC score. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation can be used to assess the model's generalization performance.\n",
